# Code First Girls Final Project - Top Trumps Game with Pokemon API
## Python and Apps course sponsored by Barclays

This project is a Python implementation of a Top Trumps game where players are allocated a Pokemon randomly, and their chosen features are compared to determine the winner. The game allows customization of the number of rounds, and players can select a stat to compare in each round. The winner of each round is determined by the highest stat value.

Extensions
Additional Characteristics: Enhance the game by adding more characteristics from the Pokemon API, providing a richer gaming experience.

Multiple Rounds: Extend the game to allow multiple rounds, increasing the excitement and competition.

Round Results Presentation: Improve the presentation of round results at the end of the game by displaying them in a table format.

Input Validation: Implement input validation to ensure that user inputs, such as the number of rounds and chosen stats, meet the specified criteria.
